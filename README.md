<h1>Tic Tac Toe </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The tic-tac-toe game is for two players. One player plays X and the other plays O (CPU). The players take turns placing their marks on a grid of three-by-three cells. If a given player gets three marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, then that player wins the game. The game will be tied if no one gets three in a row by the time all the cells are marked.
